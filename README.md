# TinyMLnotes
This repository contains my notes, code, and projects related to statistics, machine learning (ML), and TinyML.

## Contents

* **Notes:** Cheatsheets and notes covering various topics in statistics, ML, and TinyML.
* **TinyML Labs:** Lab exercises and code from MIT's TinyML course (Prof. Song Han) ([6.5940 Fall-24](https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2024-fall-65940)).
* **Android App:** An ongoing project to develop an Android application that uses a linear regression model to predict real estate prices based on user-provided zip code and square footage.

## TinyML Labs

This section includes the following labs from the MIT TinyML course:

* **Lab 1:** Introduction to TinyML and microcontrollers.
* **Lab 2:** Data collection and preprocessing for TinyML applications.
* **Lab 3:** Training and deploying a simple TinyML model.

## Android App

This project aims to build an Android app that allows users to:

* Input a zip code and square footage.
* Get a predicted real estate price based on a linear regression model.

**Current Status:** Building basic template for app. tflite for dummy model is done.

**Future Plans:** Use a full fledged model. Maybe consider LLM.

## Getting Started
