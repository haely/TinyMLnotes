# Run a simple ML model  on Android

This repository demonstrates how to run a simple ANN  model on an Android device (for now). The project aims to include a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model and a basic Android application that uses the model to make predictions.

## Project Structure

* **app:** Contains the Android application code.
* **model:** Contains the pre-trained model that can predict prices for houses. 


## Notes
* This is a basic example to illustrate how to run a machine learning model on Android.
* Consider optimizing the model for mobile deployment using techniques like quantization.
